# Honeycomb docs
## What is Honeycomb? 
* Honeycomb is a peripheral configuration versioning manager for Wild SAGE nodes. It will allow users to update and manage the state/configuration of their peripherals and the nodes they rest in.

## Why do we need this?
* When dealing with any fleet of nodes, doing the same systemic upgrade to a peripheral configuration often requires a developer to interface with the peripheral directly, which can be a massive drain of time or resources. Honeycomb will streamline the process of managing nodes, all the while keeping tabs of the overall node state for diagnostic analysis.
